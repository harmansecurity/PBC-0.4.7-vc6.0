Changes between PBC version 0.4.7 and 0.4.6

* Bugfix: element_cmp for zero case in prime field
* Symmetric pairing checks for other examples
* Faster D, G pairings

Changes between PBC version 0.4.6 and 0.4.5

* Type G pairings (embedding degree 10)
* Bugfix for version 0.4.5 random point generation

Changes between PBC version 0.4.5 and 0.4.4

* Symmetric pairing checks for example/hess.c and example/paterson.c
* Shipsey-Stange algorithm for type E pairing (not used by default)
* Random point generation is faster in some cases
* Added benchmark/ellnet.c

Changes between PBC version 0.4.4 and 0.4.3

* Optimizations for most pairings
* Shipsey-Stange algorithm for type A pairing (not used by default)

Changes between PBC version 0.4.3 and 0.4.2

* Added pairing_is_symmetric function.
* element_from_bytes for G1, G2 check input is valid.
* Added -e option for pbc.

Changes between PBC version 0.4.2 and 0.4.1

* Added element_set_str, element_snprintf, element_snprint functions.
* Added fromstr function and string handling to pbc/pbc test program.
* Minor bugfixes and cleanup.

Changes between PBC version 0.4.1 and 0.4.0

* Removed test subdirectory: moved programs to new subdirectories:
  - benchmark: programs for obtaining timings.
  - example: pairing-based cryptosystem demos.
  - gen: programs that generate pairing parameters.
  - pbc: the "Pairing-Based Calculator".
  - guru: for testing obscure parts of the library. Most need not
    know of its existence.
* Documentation for some of the above programs.
* New cryptosystem demos (by Dmitry Kosolapov).

Changes between PBC version 0.4.0 and 0.3.17

* Signatures and broadcast encryption spun off into new libraries.
* Memory leaks plugged, including two that were relatively low-level
  (and hence serious).
* New debugging facilities: if PBC_DEBUG is defined, during runtime
  PBC will check that elements from different algebraic structures are not
  mixed.
* If a memory allocation fails, PBC prints a message and quits (rather
  than quietly continuing causing unpredictable behaviour). 
* Custom memory allocation.
* All PBC header files given "pbc" prefix.
* Minor fixes.
