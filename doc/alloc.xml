<title>Custom Allocation</title>
<para>
Like GMP, PBC can be instructed to use custom memory allocation functions.
This must be done before any memory allocation is performed,
usually at the beginning of a program before any other PBC functions have
been called.
</para>
<para>
Also like GMP, the PBC wrappers around <function>malloc</function>
and <function>realloc</function> will print a message on standard error
and terminate program execution if the calls fail.
Replacements for these functions should act similarly.
</para>
<para>
However, unlike GMP, PBC does not pass the number of bytes previously allocated
along with the pointer in calls to <function>realloc</function> and
<function>free</function>.
