<title>Auxiliary Functions</title>
<para>
There are a number of abstract data types mostly only used internally by PBC.
A notable exception is the function <command>find_mnt6_curve()</command>
which appends its results to a <type>darray_t</type>.
</para>
<section><title>Dynamic Arrays</title>
<para>
The <type>darray_t</type> data type manages an array of pointers of
type <type>void *</type>, allocating more memory when necessary.
</para>
<variablelist>
&darray;
</variablelist>
</section>
<section><title>Symbol Tables</title>
<para>
The <type>symtab_t</type> data type manages symbol tables where
the keys are strings of type <type>char *</type> and the values
are pointers of
type <type>void *</type>.
</para>
<para>
At present, they are implemented inefficiently using dynamic arrays,
but this will change if the need arises.
