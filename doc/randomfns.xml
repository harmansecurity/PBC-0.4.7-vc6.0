<title>Randomness Functions</title>
<para>
The first time PBC is asked to generate a random number,
the library will try to open the file <filename>/dev/urandom</filename> as a
source of random bits. If this fails, PBC falls back to a deterministic
random number generator (which is of course completely useless for
cryptography).
</para>
<para>
It is possible to change the file used for random bits. Also, explicitly
selecting the deterministic random number generator will
suppress the warning.
